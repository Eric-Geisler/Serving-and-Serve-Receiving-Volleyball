# The Relationship of Serving to Winning in Volleyball

## Overview
This project explores the statistical relationship between **serving performance** and **match outcomes** in collegiate women’s volleyball. Using data from approximately 3,000 matches, we analyze how **service aces, service errors, service aces against, and service errors against** predict the number of sets won.

Our central hypothesis:  
> Serving outcomes (both positive and negative) significantly influence the probability of winning sets.

## Key Findings
- **Service aces** are the strongest positive predictor of sets won.  
- **Service errors** surprisingly show a positive relationship with winning — suggesting aggressive serving strategies may outweigh the risks.  
- **Opponent aces** strongly decrease the likelihood of winning sets.  
- **Opponent errors** have a minor but positive effect on winning.  
- Regression models explain ~27% of the variance in sets won, both overall and within NCAA Division III matches.

## Methods
- Data: Collegiate women’s volleyball matches (~3,000 total)  
- Statistical Analysis:  
  - Descriptive statistics and variance checks  
  - Assumption testing (linearity, normality, homoscedasticity)  
  - Correlation and regression analysis  
  - ANOVA testing for predictor significance
